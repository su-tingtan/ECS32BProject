# ECS32BProject

The ﬁnal project is to simulate a delivery truck. Each truck starts out empty but with a map that has the addresses of the post service ofﬁces and of the possible places it might need to deliver to. The truck is supposed to pick up all packages from all of the post service ofﬁces and deliver all the pakcages (but not necessarilty in that order). The truck also knows what packages there are in each post service ofﬁce. Each package has an address and a name to which the package should be delivered. The goal is to pick up and deliver all packages.
